## Explore {#Explore}

You have now been assigned to develop the AI strategy.  The first step is to scour the environment for information under which your business operates.  You are trying to seek out opportunities so that a business case can be made to sell to the stakeholders and to upper management. It is essential to gather information that traverses all the domains for you to have a high-level overview.  For this to happen, and irrespective of whether you are doing a company or a departmental strategy, it is vital that you know all the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental (PESTLE) conditions that your business and the industry serves.


## PESTLE {#PESTLE}

### Political {#Political}

Political factors in PEST analysis refer to the extent to which the government and political actions in a country influence the business climate. This is when you find out what are the employment laws if you need to find talent that doesn’t exist in the country.  What are the health and safety laws that you need to ensure that you have to adhere to ensure that the country’s laws are complied.  For example, PHI(Personal Health Information) and HIPPA regulations are health related compliances that needs to be abide by for health care solutions.  In addition, how much of taxes are being paid that affects the operating and profit margins.  
Other considerations are if there are trade restrictions that are in place either in your exiting country or in the country that you are trying to sell products or set up shops.  Having an overview of the politics of the place and the potential changes in any of the existing laws will help to guide you in shaping the strategy.

### Economic {#Economic}

When dealing with the macro-economic factors we need to consider what are the government policies of the country or the countries that your business is operating.  For example, what are the interest rate, tax rate and the current unemployment rate.  This information is readily available from government sites. Another thing that I do is how many new players and startups are now in this segment and then compare the stocks in the past year.  Table 1 shows the stock gain of the different companies and the corresponding AI involvement.

Table 1: Top10 stocks and their corresponding AI involvement as of December 2024

***Note***  *Healthcare has also a lot of data, and AI is being used as a vital cog in innovating new diagnostics and finding cures.  For example, drug delivery which used to take around 10 years to develop a product now only takes 6 months to a year to develop one. So just looking into the stock market and finding which company is using AI well should not be the only guiding principle.  If you are to look into the last 5 years you will find Nvidia is the only stock that has been there in 5 years!*

Based on that I also look into the geographical segment of the market.  Table 2 shows

Table 2: Market size of AI based on geography

I would also look into the SEC 10K for businesses in the US to find out anything that relates to any new products that have been introduced and how long they have been there.
If you are working in the industry that showed the ROE in the past 20-30 years [4] is less than compared to the other categories, then what chances are there that a change in technology would help you to leapfrog in the next category leaders.

### Social {#Social}

This is where you need to find how the customer in the wider society thinks or feels about the technology, the products, the services and the brands of the organizations.  At this stage, I usually reach out to marketing, sales and communication to find out about the existing and potential customers.  
Demographics and psychographics are aspects that marketers deal with.  The 4Ps (Product, Price, Promotion and Place) of the marketing-mix will also show how marketing is forming its own strategy and how AI is used currently in product development, or in pricing strategy, or in distribution through different channels(place) and what are the promotional efforts like branding are currently taking place.  This will also tell if there is any optimization of a sales strategy.

***Note*** *There is also 4Cs which relates to Customer(Product), Cost(Price), Communication(Promotion) and Convenience(Place).  Using this marketing mix customer personas are built.*

### Technological {#Technological}

The rapid pace at which technology is advancing in this field necessitates the revisioning of strategy.  Companies are therefore forced to be cognisant of the nature of competition in their industry and the market dynamics by dint of the impact of technology.   Do they embed AI in their processes or develop applications that opens up new vistas that increase their market share?  What are the risks of not diving into the implementation of innovative technologies and reaping the benefits? Conversely what if you take the risks and the consequences are severe? This is the conundrum that have to deal with the innovator’s dilemma.
Technology is meant to serve the business interests of the organization.  The development of AI be it product or as a service is dependent on data, technology and the talent pool that are available. How much incentives are there in the industry for you to take a leap in this direction?  Can you automate the process across the value chain of your organisation such that there is an increase in precision and speed and hence increase in operating efficiency. Are there learning opportunities in the organization to upskill or reskill your resources?  Are your employees willing to collaborate across the company and share their knowledge of how data is used across to generate value? For, it has been seen that the benefits of AI increases from 2% to 73% when both the machine (AI) and humans learn from each other and then implement the solutions.  Hence, culture has an effect in bringing about a change transformation. 

***Note*** *The need to adopt AI and make it feasible is dependent on culture. I will discuss change management in my later blogs*

Either way you source the implementation externally or internally by factoring the cost considerations so that you can deliver the value.  

### Legal {#Legal}

AI is still evolving albeit rapidly.  The developments and benefits that accrue from its implementation is tied to the audience that it is meant to serve.  This is new territory for everyone.  Organisations are not only running to find the next best thing once all the low hanging-fruits have been picked up but simultaneously gearing up to protect themselves and the customer from the harmful effects of AI. 
It is essential that AI applications comply with the privacy laws like the FIPPA, PHI and HIPPA and other laws that have been enacted. The legal department might have already drafted the provisions in accordance with the growing clamour of any regulatory framework that the countries can provide.  Countries are still trying to come up with regulations.  In Canada, as a part of AI and Data Act(AIDA)[6] (https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovation-better-canada/en/artificial-intelligence-and-data-act)is still not a regulatory framework but is striving to ensure a safe and non-discriminatory in the systems that are developed so that it can be trusted.
 EU has a high-level summary of the Act [5](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/high-level-summary/) where it states the risks associated with it and how organisations are expected to abide by it.  The Act mentions 4 points in the Summary: (1) classifies AI according to risk, (2) Obligations of providers of AI systems, (3) Obligations of deployers of AI systems and (4) General Purpose AI(GPAI).  In the summary it has also stated when human intervention would be required and in which situations AI is forbidden.
The GPAI has a working group on Responsible AI(RAI).  You will hear a lot on responsible AI, as organisations in accordance with the laws try to design, develop, and deploy Ai systems that are ethical, transparent, fair, inclusive, non-discriminatory and not antithetical to human values. So , for example, in healthcare, justice and education where human lives are affected Responsible AI can be implemented.  By promoting diversity in datasets and addressing algorithmic biases, it fosters equitable outcomes and safeguards against misuse or unintended consequences.

### Environmental {#Environmental}

AI consumes a lot of training data for it to be modelled.  If you need to fine tune the model after that there is a lot of energy that is required to increase the performance and accuracy of the model.  As such, sustainability and factors that affect the climate should also be considered as there might be legal and other compliance issues.  For example, waste water and coolant systems need to abide by the municipal or federal laws.  Eco-friendly product development [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-14108-y) that helps with sustainability can be developed.  However, in places where stringent laws are not yet in place, tools that are used to profile citizens and hence control can have a detrimental effect on society.  This is where the issue of Responsible AI comes into place. 

***Caution***: *SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunity, Threat) is also a strategic framework that is easier than most.  However, there are a number of disadvantages that one need to be mindful.  You are categorising without substantial backing of data.  Lot of it is based on subjectivity and being categorized based on the discussion.  Sometimes that which is weakness can be regarded as an opportunity while that which is strength can be regarded as weakness.*
